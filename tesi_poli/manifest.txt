This work consists of the files listed in manifest.txt

This work consists of the following files:

The files derived from the work are the following:

    toptesi.cls
    toptesi.sty
    topcoman.sty
    topfront.sty
    toptesi.cfg
    toptesi.pdf
    toptesi-example.pdf
    toptesi-example-xetex.pdf
    toptesi-example-frontespizio.pdf
    toptesi-monografia.sty
    toptesi-scudo.sty
    toptesi-magistrale.sty
    toptesi-dottorale.sty
    toptesi-sss.sty
    toptesi-it.pdf

The toptesi.dtx file is self extracting and self documenting; if you run
pdflatex on it you get at the same time the class, the style files besides 
the toptesi configuration file, together with the English documented file.

The Italian documentation is obtained by running LuaLaTeX on
toptesi-it.tex; this documentation has been completely redone compared
to previous versions. With this compiler the result should be PDF/A-1b 
compliant. The compilation of this file requires input of various .pdf 
files, mostly obtained by processing the .tex files belonging to the 
bundle. It requires also the FAKE logos of Politecnico di Torino and of 
its doctoral school. See below

The two documentations pdf files, toptesi.pdf and toptesi-it.pdf,
are complementary to one another.
 
The various files

    toptesi-example.tex
    toptesi-example-luatex.tex
    toptesi-example-frontespizio.tex
    topfront-example.tex
    toptesi-example-sss.tex
    toptesi-example-triennale.tex
    toptesi-example-magistrale.tex
    toptesi-example-dottorale.tex

are examples of the usage of this work; except the second one, explicitly 
created to be used with lualatex, all the others compile correctly 
with pdflatex; they may be used as templates, but in themselves, although 
part of this Work, they may be used by the end user the way s/he likes best, 
in order to use them as templates, but the files should not be modified unless 
their names are changed.

The files with extension .metadata are extracted form some main files and
are examples of the contents and format of the metadata that must be
included into the same directory as the thesis main file in order to be
able to use pdflatex or lualatex to produce a file that hopefully is
PDF/A-1b compliant (PDF/A-1b is the "weak" archivable PDF format).

The toptesi-scudo-example.zip contains a template file toptesi-scudo-example.tex 
file and several other files and subdirectories so that a complete example is 
available with its chapters separated in different folders, and pictures adequately 
saved in a specific subdirectories.

Warning: The PDF examples attached to this bundle contain some FAKE university 
logos; the real logos are not distributed with this bundle since they are a 
property of the specific universities. You can download them directly from 
the university sites, or you may change the logo file names with those of 
other institutions, in particular that of your own university; or you may 
substitute them with picture file names of your choice, since they are just 
examples of usage and they have no particular meaning in the sample files.

Even if Politecnico di Torino may claim a sort of "mothership" of this bundle, 
since it originated in that University (the name first three letters of this 
bundle TOPtesi may be viewed as the acronym of POlitecnico di Torino), no logos 
of this University are included in the bundle: a couple of FAKE ones, one for 
the institution and one for its doctoral school, have been created with the 
University name and location in English, which IS NOT the University legal, 
trademarked name; to be sure they are not used in place of the official ones 
both images have a "FAKE LOGO" watermark! The PH.D. students are supposed to get the official logos from the School Student Office.

Remember: you can edit the sample/template files the way you want, provided 
you change their names.
