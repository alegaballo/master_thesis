I cannot find words to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Flavio Esposito, whose encouragement, guidance and support accompanied me from the first to the last day of work, allowing me to successfully complete this project.

I would also like to thank Professor Guido Marchetto, who made this experience in the United Stated possible and has always offered his guidance.

Finally, I want to thank all the close friends I've met in these past years, for making me realize my potential, for their support in good and bad times, and for their patience.
